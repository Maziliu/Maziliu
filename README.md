<h1 align="left">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martin</h1>

<p align="left"> I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Calgary.

I have a strong interest in mobile and backend development. Since mobile development isn't covered in school, I decided to start learning Flutter on my own. I also enjoy learning and experimenting with different software architectures, with my current favourite being MVVM.

I'm always learning and building personal projects to improve my skills.
